      <description>Overdue for Part 2 so thought I&amp;rsquo;d include some of my learnings along the way&amp;hellip;&#xA;Why Warm Pools again? Taking a step back to networking for a brief second and Warm pools from Part 1. Warm Pools are very useful for scaling network appliances, for example, a set of firewall appliances in an Autoscaling Group behind a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB). This is simply because notoriously network appliances often take a long time to boot getting all their bootstrapping and inspection, IPS/IDS jazz together.</description>

      <description>So whats the scenario? I came up against conflicting customer requirements of minimising the impact of long application bootstrap times in an autoscaling group partnered along side the requirement of keeping their standard barebones EC2 AMIs interchangable. Essentially the customer did not want to have to deal with the bloat or overheads of maintaining a specific prebaked application AMI alongside an image building solution like EC2 Image Builder or a third party solution like Hashicorp Packer.</description>

      <description>Starting this year I made it key goal of mine to actively build upon whatever dev knowledge I still remember from my bachelors about 10 years ago. Of course the dev mindset is still kinda there. I started my professional endeavors in the jack of all trades infrastructure engineering space following my IT degree. With a small focus on the networking side of things. During my work I&amp;rsquo;ve always adopted the DRY mantra.</description>

      <description>In the big wide world of technology its impossible not to spent your time learning. Im often learning, testing, breaking or doing something that I never document. This is my attempt to capture what I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt (am learning). Wordpress was fun back in the day for a single post. Only time will tell if this is any better&amp;hellip;</description>
