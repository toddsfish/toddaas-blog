As I’ve increased my knowledge of AWS in the past few years, mainly due to my day to day work involving supporting the cloud networks of Business and Enterprise customers from around the world.

By doing so Im hoping to build upon the foundational knowledge required for me to take the AWS Developer Associate certification (DVA-C01). In turn I’m hoping to transform a simple web application in terms of the modern developer stacks, I keep hearing about.

Its bare bones and probably horribly coded by any seasoned developer standard. That said its a decent foundation for me to build upon to explore and incorporate some of the aforementioned developer technologies. At the same time I’m hoping to apply some of the creatively that I bring to the table. I definitely see creativity is more free flowing from the developer side of the equation, than the infrastructure the side so this will be part of the experiment.\nYou can find the application code via my github repo https://github.com/toddsfish/toddaas-social\n","wordCount":"458","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-04-07T05:10:21+10:00","dateModified":"2021-04-07T05:10:21+10:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Todd"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.toddaas.com/posts/leaning_towards_dev_ops/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"toddaas blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.toddaas.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.toddaas.com/ accesskey=h title="  (Alt + H)"></a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.toddaas.com/ title=home><span>home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.toddaas.com/posts/ title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.toddaas.com/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Leaning towards dev(ops)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-04-07 05:10:21 +1000 AEST'>April 7, 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Todd</div></header><div class=post-content><p>Starting this year I made it key goal of mine to actively build upon whatever dev knowledge I still remember from my bachelors about 10 years ago.
