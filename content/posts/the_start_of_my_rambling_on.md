In the big wide world of technology its impossible not to spent your time learning.  Im often learning, testing, breaking or doing something that I never document. This is my attempt to capture what I've learnt (am learning) and learn even more.  Wordpress was fun back in the day for a single post.  Only time will tell this is any better...
